These Terms are available for review at any time within the app and on our website.

## 3. Account Registration and Guest Accounts

### Account Registration

When you create a full Fenne account, you must provide:

- A valid email address
- Your name
- A secure password
- Accurate information

You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account credentials. Do not share your password with anyone.

### Guest Accounts

You can use Fenne as a guest without providing an email address or password. These Terms of Service apply from the moment you create a guest account by clicking "Get Started."

To convert a guest account to a full account, you must provide your name, email address, and password.

### Account Responsibility

- You may only create one account per person
- You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your account
- You must notify us immediately if you suspect unauthorized access to your account

## 4. Your Content

### Ownership

**You retain full ownership** of all recipes, meal plans, grocery lists, and other content you create in Fenne.

### License Grant to Fenne

By using the service, you grant Fenne a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to store, display, and process your content solely for the purpose of providing the Fenne service to you and your family members.

This license allows us to:
- Store your content on our servers
- Display your content to you and your family members
- Process your content to provide app functionality (such as generating grocery lists from meal schedules)

This license ends when you delete your content or your account, except as described in Section 5 (Family Sharing).

### User Representations

By posting content to Fenne, you represent and warrant that:

- You have the right to post the content you upload
- Your content does not violate any laws or third-party rights (including copyright, trademark, or privacy rights)
- Your content does not contain illegal, harmful, defamatory, or offensive material

### User Responsibility

You are solely responsible for your content and any consequences of posting it. We do not review, endorse, or take responsibility for user-generated content.

---

## 5. Family Sharing

### How It Works

Fenne allows you to invite other users to join a family group. Family members can share recipes, meal schedules, and grocery lists to coordinate meal planning together.

### Shared Content License

When you share content with your family group, you grant all family members a non-exclusive license to view, use, and modify that content within the Fenne app.

### Content Persistence After Leaving

If you leave a family group or delete your account, content you previously shared with the family remains accessible to other family members. However, your personal information (name and email) will be removed from the family group in accordance with our Privacy Policy.

This ensures that family meal plans and recipes continue to function even if one member leaves.

### Family Group Persistence

A family group continues to exist as long as at least one member remains. The family group is only deleted when all members have left or deleted their accounts.

### Modifications to Shared Content

If a family member modifies a recipe or meal plan you shared, the modified version belongs to them. The original version remains yours.

### Family Member Responsibility

All family members must be at least 13 years old and agree to these Terms of Service. There are no exceptions—children under 13 cannot use Fenne even if invited by a parent.

### Invitations

When you invite someone to join your family group, you are responsible for ensuring that:
- The invited user consents to joining your family group
- The invited user is at least 13 years old
- You have the right to share the invited user's email address with Fenne

---

## 6. Acceptable Use Policy

You agree NOT to use Fenne to:

- Engage in any illegal activity or violate any local, national, or international laws
- Post content that is illegal, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, invasive of privacy, hateful, or otherwise objectionable
- Impersonate any person or entity, or falsely state or misrepresent your affiliation with any person or entity
- Upload or transmit viruses, malware, or any other malicious code
- Attempt to gain unauthorized access to Fenne's systems, servers, or other users' accounts

- Use automated systems (bots, scrapers, or similar tools) to access Fenne
- Spam other users or abuse the family invitation system
- Interfere with or disrupt the service, servers, or networks connected to Fenne
- Collect or harvest personal information about other users without their consent

## 9. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability

### Nature of Service

Fenne is a note-taking and organizational tool for meal planning. You create and manage your own content—we do not provide, recommend, or endorse any recipes, meal plans, or dietary information.

All content in the app is user-generated. You are solely responsible for evaluating the accuracy, safety, and suitability of any recipes or meal plans you create or use.

### Limitation of Liability (German Law Compliance)

Under German law, our liability is structured as follows:

**Unlimited Liability:**  
We are fully liable for damages caused by intent (Vorsatz) or gross negligence (grobe Fahrlässigkeit) on our part, and for personal injury (including death or bodily harm).

**Limited Liability for Essential Obligations:**  
For breach of essential contractual obligations (Kardinalpflichten) through simple negligence, our liability is limited to foreseeable, typical damages that are reasonably expected to arise from this type of contract.

**No Liability for Non-Essential Obligations:**  
We are not liable for simple negligence regarding non-essential contractual obligations.

### Statutory Consumer Rights

Nothing in these Terms affects your statutory rights as a consumer under applicable law.

If you are a consumer in the European Union, mandatory consumer protection laws of your country of residence apply and cannot be excluded or limited by these Terms.

- Your authentication tokens will be invalidated
- You will no longer have access to the Fenne service

### Content Persistence

### Separate Terms

When paid features are introduced, separate terms governing subscriptions, payments, refunds, cancellations, and billing will apply. You will be notified of these terms before any charges are made.
