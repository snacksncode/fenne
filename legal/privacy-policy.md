## 3. Information We Collect

We collect different types of information to provide you with the Fenne service. Here's what we collect and why:

### a) Account Information

When you create an account or convert from a guest account, you provide:

- **Email address** — Used for login and to identify your account
- **Name** — Displayed to you and to family members if you join a family group
- **Password** — Transmitted securely over HTTPS and stored as a hashed value on our server. We never store passwords in plaintext.

### b) Content You Create

To provide the core meal planning functionality, we store:

- **Recipes** — Including recipe name, ingredients (with quantities and units), meal types (breakfast, lunch, dinner), preparation time, notes, and whether you've liked or favorited the recipe
- **Meal schedules** — Your weekly meal plans, including which recipes are assigned to breakfast, lunch, or dinner for each day, dining-out entries with custom names, and markers for shopping days
- **Grocery lists** — Item names, quantities, units, aisle categories, and completion status
- **Custom food items and ingredients** — Names and aisle categories for ingredients you've added

### c) Family and Social Data

If you use Fenne's family sharing features:

- **Family group membership** — Which users are part of your family group
- **Invitations** — When you invite someone or receive an invitation, we store the name and email address of both the sender and recipient

**Important:** When you join a family group, all family members can see your name and email address. Family members can also see all shared recipes, meal schedules, and grocery lists. This sharing is essential to the family coordination features of Fenne.

### d) Search Queries

- **Food and ingredient search terms** — When you search for ingredients or food items, your search query is sent to our server to return relevant results. These queries are processed in real-time and are not stored long-term.

### e) Automatically Collected Data

- **Authentication tokens** — Session identifiers that keep you logged in. These are stored securely on your device using expo-secure-store.
- **Network connectivity status** — Checked locally on your device to determine if you're online. This information is not sent to our server.
- **Server logs** — Our server may automatically log IP addresses, request timestamps, and request paths for security, debugging, and operational purposes. These logs are retained for up to 90 days.

### f) Data We Do NOT Collect

We want to be clear about what we don't collect:

- Device identifiers (no IDFA, no Android Advertising ID)
- Location data or GPS coordinates
- Your contacts or address book
- Photos, camera data, or media files
- Biometric data
- Payment or billing information
- Usage analytics or behavioral tracking
- Advertising identifiers

## 4. How We Use Your Information

We use your information to:

- **Provide core app functionality** — Enable you to create recipes, plan meals, manage grocery lists, and schedule your week
- **Enable family sharing** — Allow you to coordinate meal planning with family members
- **Authenticate your identity** — Verify who you are when you log in and maintain your session
- **Respond to support requests** — Help you when you contact us with questions or issues
- **Maintain security and prevent abuse** — Protect our service from unauthorized access, fraud, and misuse
- **Improve app stability** — In the future, we may introduce anonymous crash and error reporting to identify and fix bugs (see Section 7 for details)

We do not use your information for advertising, marketing, or any purpose unrelated to providing the Fenne service.

---

## 5. Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR)

Under GDPR Article 6, we process your personal data based on the following legal grounds:

- **Contract performance (Art. 6(1)(b))** — Processing your account data, recipes, meal schedules, and grocery lists is necessary to provide the Fenne service you signed up for. Without this processing, we cannot deliver the app's core functionality.

- **Legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(f))** — We maintain server logs (IP addresses, timestamps, request paths) for security, fraud prevention, and debugging purposes. This processing is necessary to protect our service and users from abuse and to ensure the app functions correctly.

- **Consent (Art. 6(1)(a))** — If we introduce optional features in the future (such as anonymous crash reporting or analytics), we will ask for your explicit consent before collecting any additional data.

---

## 6. Data Sharing and Third Parties

We respect your privacy and do not sell or misuse your data.

- **We do NOT sell your data** to anyone
- **We do NOT share your data with advertisers**
- **We do NOT use third-party analytics or tracking services**

Here's who can access your data:

### Family Members

If you join a family group, other family members can see:
- Your name and email address
- All recipes, meal schedules, and grocery lists shared within the family

This sharing is essential to the family coordination features of Fenne.

### Hosting Provider

Your data is stored on servers operated by **Hetzner Online GmbH** in Falkenstein, Germany. Hetzner acts as a data processor on our behalf and is contractually obligated to protect your data in accordance with GDPR.

### Future Crash and Error Reporting

We may introduce anonymous crash and error reporting in the future to improve app stability. If we do:
- This will only collect technical information about errors (device type, OS version, error stack traces)
- It will NOT include any personal data, recipes, meal plans, or other user content
- This policy will be updated to name the specific service provider we use

---

## 7. Data Storage and Security

We take the security of your data seriously:

- **Server location** — All your data is stored on Hetzner servers in Falkenstein, Germany (within the European Union)
- **Encryption in transit** — All data transmitted between your device and our server is encrypted using HTTPS
- **Secure token storage** — Authentication tokens are stored on your device using expo-secure-store, which uses encrypted storage
- **Local cache** — App data may be cached locally on your device for offline access. This cache is protected by your device's built-in security (passcode or biometrics) but is not separately encrypted by the app. The cache is automatically cleared after 7 days or when you log out.
- **Password security** — Passwords are hashed on the server using industry-standard algorithms and are never stored in plaintext
- **Real-time sync** — Data synchronization uses secure WebSocket connections

While we implement strong security measures, no system is completely secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security, but we are committed to protecting your data to the best of our ability.

## 8. Data Retention

- **Active accounts** — Your data is retained for as long as your account is active
- **Account deletion** — When you delete your account, your personal data is removed from our servers within 30 days
- **Server logs** — IP addresses, timestamps, and request paths in server logs are retained for up to 90 days for security purposes, then automatically deleted
- **Backup copies** — Backup copies may persist for up to 30 days after deletion, after which they are permanently removed
- **Family content** — If you are part of a family group, recipes and schedules you contributed may remain visible to other family members after your account deletion, but your personal information (name and email) will be removed
